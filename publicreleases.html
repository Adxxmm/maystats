                    Hello everyone, we are glad to finally have the opportunity to become the official statistics provider for the State of Mayflower. Our duties will be highlighted in this letter as well as in our Trello and handbook.<br>
                    <br>
                        The State Statistics Sector, informally known as “MaySTATS” is the official statistics office of the State of Mayflower. Our duties are to take data from a variety of sources such as departments, logs, in-game logs and more. We take this data and convert it into something that is visually appealing to citizens. We strive to ensure this data makes as much sense as possible by including graphs and charts, brief descriptions, and thoughtful analysis provided by our skillful statisticians. This data may be viewed at any time on our website which should be released within the coming days. Data is updated when made available; weekly, monthly and yearly depending on the availability of said data. We take pride in the accuracy of our data, if you see a problem or data discrepancy, please refer to one of our statisticians or the Director of State Statistics, AdxmPlayz.<br>
                    <br>
                        We work hard to study trends in everything and hopefully this provides a helpful perspective on Mayflower in detail! All of our statistics are made available on our website, and raw data can be found directly within our Trello if you prefer seeing the data or using it for your own purposes. All data is made public by this sector and is free for use by all. Operations will be in full swing within the next few days.<br>
                    <br>
